      'As one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the Great Barrier Reef holds a spot on every traveler&apos;s bucket list. Hugging the east coast of Queensland, Australia, the Great Barrier Reef extends from Cape York in the north all the way to Bundaberg in the south — a total of 1,250 miles. With roughly 3,000 coral reefs, 600 islands and 1,625 species of fish, the reef leaves its 1.6 million annual visitors enchanted.'

      'The small island of Bora Bora (just 6 miles long and more than 2 miles wide) overflows with beauty. Dormant volcanoes rise up at its center and fan out into lush jungle before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote &quot;Tales of the South Pacific,&quot; called Bora Bora &quot;the most beautiful island in the world.&quot; The 18th-century British explorer James Cook even coined it as the &quot;pearl of the Pacific.&quot; The very definition of a tropical getaway, blissful Bora Bora abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters and friendly locals. and as you might&apos;ve already guessed, the main industry on this petite island in French Polynesia and its swarm of tiny motu (small surrounding islands) is tourism. To that end, you can snorkel, explore Vaitape (Bora Bora&apos;s quaint town), hike Mount Otemanu and more. But there&apos;s a catch: Bora Bora is expensive — very expensive. In short, visit Bora Bora for natural beauty, visit for utter relaxation and visit if you have the money.&apos;'    ]

      'This little city, tucked amid the Tuscan hills, casts a long shadow through history. The wellspring of the Renaissance, Firenze (or Florence) sheltered the powerful Medici family and inspired artists like Michelangelo (David) and Brunelleschi (the Duomo). If it weren&apos;t for the fashionable Italians and chic shops lining Via Tornabuoni, you might think you had traveled back in time to the 14th century. But Renaissance art is not the only reason to come: You also visit Florence for its gorgeous sunsets, its Italian cooking and its unbeatable romantic charm.'

      '&quot;Animated&quot; is perhaps the best word to describe Tokyo. Crazy about its anime, Japan&quot;s mega city is constantly buzzing with movement—feet clack down sidewalks, cars zoom along streets, subway trains hum below ground, ships cruise in and out. And yet bright lights and loud signs beg you to pause, to break your motion for just one second to pray (oops, we mean pay) at the altar of consumerism. This is a city that feeds on motion and progress. But when you want to stop in Tokyo, the city will certainly make it worth your while. The tech savvy locales may whizz past the monuments and urban parks daily (except during the cherry blossom season when everyone floods the green space), but, we assure you, the museums and historical sites are world-class. Here, there are photos to be taken, sushi to be eaten, and a lot of shopping to be done. So what are you waiting for? You better get a move on.&quot;'

      'The English writer Samuel Johnson famously said, &quot;You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.&quot; More than two centuries have passed since Johnson&apos;s era, but his words still ring true. Life in London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers find that one visit isn&apos;t enough to experience everything this two-millennia-old city has to offer. Here, the antiquated clasps hands with the contemporary. You&apos;ll find the historic Tower of London and the avant-garde Tate Modern both considered big must-sees. Shakespeare&apos;s sonnets are still being uttered by actors who don modern garb. Londoners most certainly still respect the royals, but they also jam to the likes of Arctic Monkeys and Adele. And while they still praise the power of tea, they now make room for some Starbucks here and there, and pressed juice too. A current leader in everything from politics and banking to fashion and music, London&apos;s culture compass is always attuned to what&apos;s next.'

      'Cusco, known as the archaeological capital of the Americas, is home to a storied history that included the rise and fall of the Inca Empire followed by the invasion of Spanish conquistadors in the early 1500s. Today, remnants of both eras share the narrow city streets – from centuries-old baroque cathedrals to exquisite stone masonry – creating a rare collision of Andean and Spanish styles that makes Cusco like no other place on earth. The city has come out of the shadow of Peru&apos;s capital, Lima, in recent decades. Millions of tourists make the pilgrimage from Cusco and the Sacred Valley to get a glimpse of South America&apos;s greatest spectacle: Machu Picchu. Discovered by American explorer Hiram Bingham in the early 20th century, the fabled ruins are one of the most impressive architectural feats of the ancient world. But the enchanting city offers more: from the glimmering Qorikancha (Temple of the Sun) to scrumptious Andean cuisine. It only takes a day to be charmed by this significant Peruvian city and all its wonders.'

Amid Gotham&apos;s iconic landmarks and towering skyscrapers, you&apos;ll experience a vibrant culture permeating each of the city&apos;s distinctive neighborhoods and boroughs. Follow trendsetters to the East Village and Brooklyn to check out indie boutiques, iconic bakeries and trendy coffee shops. Afterward, peruse the racks of the sleek shops lining Fifth Avenue, admire the cutting-edge art collections at the MoMa and the Met, catch a memorable show on Broadway or sit down for a meal at the latest &quot;it&quot; restaurant. As the most populous city in the U.S. — set at the forefront of food, fashion and the arts — NYC requires stamina. But don&apos;t let the Big Apple&apos;s frenetic sights and sounds intimidate you from soaking up its grandeur. Wander through the concrete jungle and you&apos;ll discover roaring taxicabs pouring down bustling blocks, fast-paced pedestrians whizzing past on their way to marquee galleries and innovative cocktail bars and Times Square&apos;s neon lights flickering at all hours. And yet, the city&apos;s twinkling lights and chaotic corners also invite you to embrace every New York minute, explore every flourishing enclave and create your own urban adventure. There are virtually endless ways to occupy your time in the city that never sleeps, but before you leave, stop and look around — what&apos;s here today will be transformed into something bigger and better tomorrow.'

      'Maui is not nearly as large as the Big Island, nor is it as small as Lanai, as bustling as Oahu or as quiet as Kauai. For many Hawaii vacationers, Maui is just right — offering a taste of just about everything the Aloha State has to offer, from impressive wildlife to intriguing history and culture. While on a visit here, you can shimmy alongside professional hula dancers, golf along coastal fairways, snorkel alongside five different types of sea turtles or simply lounge along some of Hawaii&apos;s most notable beaches. One of the archipelago&apos;s most popular tourism spots, Maui can be found sandwiched between the Big Island and the much tinier Molokai. Maui is divided into five distinct regions: Many travelers base themselves along the coasts of South Maui (home to the famous Wailea Beach) or West Maui, where the sands of Kaanipali Beach and the music from the Old Lahaina Luau are located. But the rest of the island should not be missed. Travel along the Road to Hana to experience East Maui&apos;s scenic coastline, explore Haleakala — the world&apos;s largest dormant volcano — in the Upcountry, and explore the former tribal battlegrounds of Central Maui&apos;s Iao Valley State Park.'

Resting at the mouth of a bay harbor, the city is lined with white-sand beaches, lush rainforests and surrounded by staggered green mountains. Rio de Janeiro boasts dramatic views from nearly every angle. From the slopes of Corcovado Mountain, you&apos;ll admire the striking 125-foot-tall Christ the Redeemer, who overlooks Rio&apos;s pristine beaches. And from the shores of Copacabana and Ipanema, you&apos;ll admire the picture-perfect backdrop that has attracted Cariocas (native Brazilians born in Rio de Janeiro) and visitors alike for more than 500 years. But there&apos;s much more to Rio than scenic vistas, tropical rainforests and cerulean seas. Here, glitz, high fashion and a laid-back attitude dominate the city&apos;s character. Stroll along Avenida Atlântica in Copa, and you&apos;ll find a city brimming with bikini-clad beachgoers. The city is also known for its love of sport. From Maracana Stadium (home of the 2014 World Cup finals and the 2016 Olympic Games) to the volleyball courts of Flamengo Park, the city is alive with activity. At night, you&apos;ll hear the soothing sounds of samba pulsating through the city streets in Lapa. And if you visit in February — just in time for Carnival — you&apos;ll witness Brazil&apos;s vibrant Portuguese masquerade that draws revelers from across the globe. Next up for the Marvelous City: hosting the 2016 Olympic Games. The country has spent upward of $14 billion on creating the Olympic infrastructure and the expansion of its public transportation.'

Travel east and you&apos;ll find whales gliding through Peninsula Valdés&apos; marine wildlife sanctuary. Venture to Southern Patagonia, and you&apos;ll stumble upon deserts extending into rugged estancias (cattle-ranges) and melting glaciers. And, if you continue downward to the Chilean border at Cape Horn, you&apos;ll come across an expansive horizon reaching out to Antarctica&apos;s frosty edge. Patagonia&apos;s beauty knows no bounds. But don&apos;t let the frontier&apos;s vastness fool you: Argentine Patagonia&apos;s rapidly developing infrastructure grants visitors easy access to all major attractions. Rustic roads lead to dramatic natural wonders like Perito Moreno Glacier and Mount Fitz Roy. Look around this beautiful landscape and discover a region buzzing with life. Magellanic penguins and albatross mingle in the Punta Tombo wildlife reserve, while history survives on the walls of the Cave of the Hands.'
